<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://kautukthakur.com)

There are many great Chatting Application available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Chatting Application so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on your work instead of privacy, YouChat is 100% Secure.
* You shouldn't be wasting even a milisecond during a chat, YouChat is peer to peer, so it saves your time between chat transactions.
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, we are not filled with features as of big companies but I assure I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed.

### Built With
YouChat is built with love using three major frameworks of JavaScript, these frameworks are best for creating useful programs like YouChat since they avail Secure, fast and reliable outcomes.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [SocketIO](https://socket.io)
